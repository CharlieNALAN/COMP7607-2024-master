However, I will attempt to break it down and provide a solution.\n\nThe problem states that there are 16 ducks, and each lays 1 egg. Then, 4 ducks lay 3 eggs each, and 2 of these eggs are eaten. The problem asks how many eggs are laid in total.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* 16 ducks lay 1 egg each, so they lay 16 eggs.\n* 4 ducks lay 3 eggs each, so they lay 4 x 3 = 12 eggs.\n* In total, 16 + 12 = 28 eggs are laid.\n* However, 2 of these eggs are eaten, so the total number of eggs laid is 28 - 2 = 26.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n#### 26", "prompt_tokens": 7419, "completion_tokens": 4449, "total_tokens": 11868, "time": 5.216789245605469, "prompt": "Please rewrite the following mathematical question to be more understandable and easy to answer.
